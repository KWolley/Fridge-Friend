## Vision Statement
This novel app will reduce food waste by tracking expiration dates, reccomended use by for produce, with the addition of grocery planning based on your weekly meal plan and what already exists in your kitchen.

## Motivations
An ease of use, time reduction, make life easier app.

## Risks to project completion
In summary, we have no experience building web-based applications.  There is new programming language experience needed for development of this app (HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, et al).  Time management and scheduling betweeen teammates in different time zones, outside normal working hours will be challenging. Little guidance in the development of program may reduce focus in key areas. 

## Mitigation Strategy for above risks
Office hours for questions related to programming tools and methods.  Online resources for tutorials and examples in new frameworks will also be very beneficial.  Managing work in a way so that all team members will be on the same page will best be solved with frequent communication.  

## Development method: scrum, kanban, waterfall: with specifics!
The scrum development method will be used.  We will build based on the user story with the understanding that the project will be continuously evolved. As features are added, a sprint will be organized by the scrum master to attempt to address new feature implementation.  

## Project Tracking Software (Trello is most common)
For now, GitHub will be used as the "tracking software".  We feel that the assigment is simple enough that we can use this simple technique to track project milestones. Branches with associated documentation should provide a holistic view of target goals for the application. After early development, if more specific tools seem beneficial to manage the project scope additional options may be explored (likely Trello or others).
