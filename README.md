## Vision Statement
This novel app will reduce food waste by tracking expiration dates, reccomended use by for produce, with the addition of grocery planning based on your weekly meal plan and what already exists in your kitched=n.

## Motivations
An ease of use, time reduction, make life easier app.

## Risks to project completion
In summary, we have no idea what we are doing.  There is not a wide variety of programming language experience for development of this app.  Time and scheduling people in different time zones, outside normal working hours will be.  
Guidance in the development of program.
Team banter for best buy dates.

## Mitigation Strategy for above risks
Office hours for questions related to programming tools and methods.  Online resources for tutorials will also be very beneficial.  How to manage data collection in a way that all team members will be able to find the information easier.  

## Development method: scrum, kanban, waterfall: with specifics!
The scrum development method will be used.  We will build based on the user story with the understanding that the project will be continuously evolved. As features are added, a sprint will be organized by the scrum master to attempt to address this feature.  

## Project Tracking Software (Trello is most common)
For now, GitHub will be used as the "tracking software".  We feel that the assigment is simple enough that we can use this simple technique to track project milestones.
