Couple thoughts for getting some unit tests up and running and general items to implement

Calender/Dates:
How to handle?
Expirations are in d (days), w (weeks), m (months)
datetime python library
Select item - check valid
Purchase date - check valid
Determine expiry - check valid
Assert invalids throw exceptions

User:
Valid names, ids, other?
Assert improper uses throw exceptions

Shopping list:
Add/remove
min/max qty
valid item

Recipes:
Valid ingredient ids
Have/need to buy
EXECUTE RECIPE FOR DINNER (read like a robot lol)
remove items after EXECUTING DINNER

Stability:
update datetimes
soon to expire items prompt
priority list soon to expires
